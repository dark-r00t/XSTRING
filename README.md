# XSTRING

### A simple re-implementation of the already existing <string.h> library.

### Make Commands: 
``make`` - Creates object files and creates a binary exxecutable.
<br>``make clean`` - Deletes all previously generated files.
<br>``make rebuild`` - Deletes all previously generated files, and then recompiles.

### How to Run:
``./bin/string`` (I don't know if it's the same on Windows)
